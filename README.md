## Troubleshooting

**Windows:** Do not run your VSCode or Discord as admin, there is no reason to and it just further complicates everything down the line.

**Linux:** Discord versions installed using `flatpak` or `snap` need modifications in order to support IPC. In order to avoid this (and as Discord itself suggests) you should download it from [discord.com](https://discord.com/download)
